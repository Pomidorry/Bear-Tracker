# Bear Tracker 🐻🌍📍

## Short description:
In this project I worked for Ursus Park, a fictitious national park. The application I created allows rangers to track and find information about bears that are wandering in the park.

## Each project's LWC description in a nutshell:
- helloWebComponent - LWC to set and test Salesforce app access
- bearLocation - LWC that show geolocation of specific bear inside matching record
- bearMap - LWC that show geolocations of all bears (or specific bears that you want to search) on Home page map
- bearSupervisor - LWC that can provide info about specific bear supervisor inside matching record related to this bear
- bearTile - a card with info about specific bear
- bearList - LWC that contains list of cards about each bear (or specific bears that you want to search) (via tag related to bearTile component)
